# Research Toolchain

This repository keeps runtime code and reverse-engineering research code separate.

## Layout

- `third_party/CUE4Parse`: pinned submodule for offline pak/utoc/usmap/package inspection. Current pin: `c43d6707cbde0305e2970d7c527e2ccd26f393c7`.
- `third_party/UnrealMappingsDumper`: patched source snapshot for runtime `.usmap` experiments.
- `tools/asset_probe`: .NET probe that verifies whether CUE4Parse can mount archives and deserialize mesh packages.
- `tools/mesh_planner`: offline UV planner prototype that reads exported LOD0 mesh JSON, classifies front/side/back target UV samples, and optionally colorizes them from front-capture samples.
- `scripts/research`: explicit scripts for research builds and injection. Normal `make build` and `make package` do not call these.

Future agent turns should start with [`agent-state.md`](agent-state.md) before changing the research tooling.

## Bootstrap

```powershell
git submodule update --init --recursive
.\scripts\research\build-asset-probe.ps1
.\scripts\research\build-mesh-planner.ps1
.\scripts\research\build-mapping-dumper.ps1
```

## Asset Probe

Run without a mapping file to confirm the expected mapping failure:

```powershell
.\scripts\research\run-asset-probe.ps1 -AllowFailure
```

Run with a generated mapping:

```powershell
.\scripts\research\run-asset-probe.ps1 -UsmapPath .build\research\mappings\Mappings.usmap -GameVersion GAME_UE5_6 -PackageLimit 1000 -AllowFailure
```

The probe writes `.build\research\profiles\asset-probe-latest.json`. A useful mapping should get past package load, report nonzero mapping/read properties, and convert sampled meshes with nonzero LOD vertices and indices.

For direct-bake research, export top SkeletalMesh LOD0 geometry:

```powershell
.\scripts\research\run-asset-probe.ps1 -UsmapPath .build\research\mappings\Mappings.usmap -GameVersion GAME_UE5_6 -PackageLimit 13000 -ExportTopSkeletal 10 -AllowFailure
```

This writes generated JSON files to `.build\research\mesh_exports\`. These files include LOD0 positions, normals, UVs, indices, bone influences, reference bones, material slots, skeleton asset, physics asset, and bounds. They are generated research outputs and should not be committed.

Prepare the local runtime mesh profile sidecar after a game update:

```powershell
.\scripts\research\prepare-mesh-profile.ps1
```

This validates the expected `paintman` LOD0 shape and writes `.build\bin\runtime-bridge.dll.mesh-profile.json`. `make package` includes that sidecar only when it already exists.

## Mesh Planner

After exporting `paintman` LOD0 geometry and running one paint with the current bridge, generate an offline UV plan:

```powershell
.\scripts\research\run-mesh-planner.ps1
```

By default this reads:

- `.build\research\mesh_exports\paintman-Chameleon_Content_3Dmodel_cLeon_charactor_paintman_skeltal_paintman.uasset.lod0.json`
- `%LOCALAPPDATA%\MecchaCamouflage\runtime\last_status.json`

It writes `.build\research\uv_plans\paintman-uv-plan-latest.json`. The planner uses the latest runtime camera direction, bind-pose triangle normals, and UV triangles to classify front/side/back surfaces. It emits all regions and marks unsafe candidates instead of dropping them. This is a research artifact only; it does not call the bridge or send paint to a server.

To attach nearest front-capture color to the side/back UV samples, run the app with research artifacts enabled and perform one normal hotkey paint:

```bash
MECCHA_RESEARCH_ARTIFACTS=1 make run
```

When running `scripts\dev.ps1` directly from PowerShell, pass `-EnableResearchArtifacts` instead. This flag is migration-only; formal runtime behavior should not depend on it.

The bridge then writes a generated `*.front_samples.json` sidecar under `%LOCALAPPDATA%\MecchaCamouflage\runtime\native\`. `run-mesh-planner.ps1` automatically picks the newest one and adds nearest front-sample color fields to each target sample. Without that file, the planner still emits UV-only targets.

Useful planner checks:

```powershell
.\scripts\research\run-mesh-planner.ps1
```

```bash
jq '{FrontSampleCount, TriangleStats, sample_count:(.TargetSamples|length), first:.TargetSamples[0]}' .build/research/uv_plans/paintman-uv-plan-latest.json
jq -r '.TargetSamples[] | select(.SourceDistanceUv != null) | .SourceDistanceUv' .build/research/uv_plans/paintman-uv-plan-latest.json | sort -n
```

Interpretation:

- `FrontSampleCount == 0`: UV-only plan. No color replay should be considered.
- `FrontSampleCount > 0`: colorized plan. Still offline-only.
- `Diagnostics.UnsafeCandidateCount > 0`: enabled-region replay should be blocked until the cause is understood.
- Large `SourceDistanceUv` values indicate unsafe color transfer. Current raw nearest-neighbor transfer has p95 around `0.20`, so filtering or planner logic must improve before replay.

Generated files under `.build\research\mesh_exports\`, `.build\research\uv_plans\`, and `%LOCALAPPDATA%\MecchaCamouflage\runtime\native\*.front_samples.json` are not source artifacts and should not be committed.

## Mapping Dumper

Only inject a locally built DLL. The upstream prebuilt DLL crashed in MECCHA CHAMELEON and must not be reused.

```powershell
.\scripts\research\build-mapping-dumper.ps1
.\scripts\research\inject-mapping-dumper.ps1 -Mode Probe
```

If probe mode is stable, use object scan before a full dump:

```powershell
.\scripts\research\inject-mapping-dumper.ps1 -Mode ObjectScan
```

Object scan validates guarded `GObjects` traversal without writing `.usmap`. Use it after game updates or dumper changes before full dump.

If probe and object scan are stable, dump mode can be tried once:

```powershell
.\scripts\research\inject-mapping-dumper.ps1 -Mode Dump
```

The injection script refuses to inject the same DLL hash twice unless `-Force` is passed intentionally.

Current MECCHA CHAMELEON UE 5.6 dump status:

- Local patched dumper generates `.build\research\mappings\Mappings.usmap` without crashing the game.
- Observed dump wrote `10807` structs and `37740` serializable properties.
- The generated mapping lets CUE4Parse convert sampled StaticMeshes and all currently found SkeletalMeshes to LOD vertex/index data.
- Latest full asset probe found `805` StaticMesh exports and `16` SkeletalMesh exports, and exported `10` top SkeletalMesh LOD0 geometry files under `.build\research\mesh_exports\`.
